# 🔎 Employee Directory
### Employee directory project based on the [Treehouse Front-End Techdegree](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/)

## Project Overview:

In this project, I was challenged with using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and using the data to build an Awesome Startup employee directory. 

I requested a JSON object from the API using fetch and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s entry opens a modal window with more detailed information such as the employee’s birthday and address.

## Tools/skills used:
* HTML5
* CSS Grid
* Responsive Design
* JavaScript
* Fetch

#### I originally created this project for my front-end Techdegree, but I was never proud of the code I wrote. I've removed my original jQuery and added CSS grid, and now I'm a little more happy with the result. Perfectionist? Me? Never! 😉
